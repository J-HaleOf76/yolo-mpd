Various MPD tweaks and tips and tools and scripts I've put together or found and tweaked.

#mediakey.sh

This script uses the MPRIS interface to control your media players.  Currently supported players include MPD, Pithos, Audacious, and Clementine

#simple_covers

Uses glyr, mpc, and eye3D to fetch covers from files and the interwebs.  Can now not only find the current playing song from MPD, but can walk a directory tree.

#mpdjay

Small tweaks and changes to the script by rozzin;  you probably want to use that instead
